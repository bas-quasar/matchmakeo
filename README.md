# `matchmakeo`

`matchmakeo` (*match-make-EE-OH*, [*mæʧ meɪk ee əʊ*]) is a python package to help with finding related earth observation data from two or more different sources. For example, if you wanted to find images from Sentinel-1 and MODIS of overlapping locations that were taken within 1 hour of each other.

## Get started


## Development

For working on development of `matchmakeo` we use [`pixi`](https://pixi.sh/) for managing PyPI and conda packages as well as for running deveopment tasks such as testing and linting. It isn't necessary for contributing to the package, but it's a nice tool. You can also use whatever python virtual environment manager you prefer + conda or even not use conda at all.
